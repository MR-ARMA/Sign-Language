# Introduction

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **real-time sign language recognition system** using **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques. By leveraging **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow**, this system is capable of detecting and classifying different signs based on their unique hand gestures and pose landmarks. The system offers potential benefits in applications such as **assistive technology for the hearing-impaired** and **human-computer interaction** by interpreting sign language in real-time.

## Motivation and Purpose

Sign language is a critical communication tool for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities. However, despite its importance, communication barriers exist for individuals who do not understand sign language. This project aims to bridge this communication gap by creating a system that can interpret and translate sign language gestures into text, fostering more inclusive communication.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **To develop a real-time gesture detection system** that can identify and classify specific hand gestures, specifically in Persian sign language.
2. **To collect and preprocess video data** for training the model, using gestures associated with common Persian words such as “Gorbe” (cat), “Ghaza” (food), and “Komak” (help).
3. **To implement a robust deep learning model** for gesture classification using LSTM layers, optimized to predict the intended gestures accurately and efficiently.

By achieving these goals, the project seeks to contribute to **assistive technology** and **AI-driven communication tools** that support individuals with communication difficulties.

## Technical Approach

This project employs a range of tools, libraries, and methodologies:

### Libraries and Tools

- **MediaPipe**: For detecting and tracking holistic landmarks, including face, pose, and hand landmarks.
- **OpenCV**: To capture video frames and process images for input into the machine learning model.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training a deep learning model, with an LSTM-based architecture to capture temporal features in the sign gestures.
- **Matplotlib**: To visualize key points and monitor model performance.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset is composed of video sequences representing the gestures for each target word. The data is preprocessed as follows:

1. **Landmark Extraction**: Key points are extracted from face, pose, and hand landmarks using MediaPipe’s holistic model.
2. **Normalization and Flattening**: The extracted key points are normalized and flattened, forming a consistent input shape across sequences.
3. **Data Augmentation**: Given the limited dataset, basic augmentation techniques are applied to enhance model generalization.

### Model Architecture

The model is based on a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network**:

- **Input Layer**: 30-frame sequences, where each frame is represented by 1,662 features (pose, face, and hand keypoints).
- **LSTM Layers**: Three stacked LSTM layers to capture temporal relationships within gesture sequences.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers to condense the information and predict the final class label.
- **Softmax Output**: The model outputs probabilities for each class, enabling it to make predictions on the gesture performed.

### Training and Evaluation

The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained using **categorical cross-entropy** loss, with metrics tracked through **TensorBoard** for real-time feedback. Model evaluation is performed using **accuracy** and **confusion matrices** to analyze the classifier's performance on the test set.

### Visualization and Prediction

During real-time inference, the model's predictions are visualized through an **OpenCV interface**. This includes:

- **Landmark Visualization**: Visual representations of face, pose, and hand landmarks.
- **Prediction Display**: Real-time display of predictions, showing the most probable gesture and confidence levels.
- **Gesture Confidence Bar**: Probability visualization for each class to give a clearer view of model confidence.

## Applications and Impact

This project has promising applications in various fields:

- **Assistive Technology**: Can be integrated into devices that assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments, facilitating real-time sign language interpretation.
- **Education**: Sign language learners can use the system to practice and verify their gestures.
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: The technology can serve as a hands-free interface, allowing users to control devices through gestures in settings where voice or touch input is challenging.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

While this project achieves accurate gesture recognition in specific Persian sign language gestures, there are several areas for future development:

1. **Extending Vocabulary**: Increase the number of signs and gestures the model can recognize, incorporating a broader vocabulary.
2. **Improving Model Generalization**: By training on a larger and more diverse dataset, the model can be enhanced to recognize variations in gestures.
3. **Real-Time Translation**: Further development could enable more fluid real-time translation, interpreting entire sentences in sign language rather than individual gestures.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning and computer vision in creating assistive tools for sign language recognition. By building on this foundation and addressing the identified limitations, future iterations can further enhance accessibility and communication for individuals who rely on sign language.
