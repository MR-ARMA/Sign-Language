# Roadmap

## Project Overview

This roadmap outlines the timeline, phases, and milestones for developing a **real-time sign language recognition system** using deep learning and computer vision. The project will be implemented in **four main phases**, with each phase building upon the previous one to ensure progressive development and evaluation of key deliverables. 

## Project Phases and Timeline

### **Phase 1: Research and Planning**
**Timeline**: Weeks 1 - 2

**Objectives**: Lay the foundation for the project by defining the goals, gathering resources, and preparing the environment for data collection and model development.

- **Week 1**
  - **Literature Review**: Research existing work on sign language recognition and identify potential datasets, tools, and algorithms. Review key papers related to MediaPipe, OpenCV, and LSTM-based deep learning for gesture recognition.
  - **System Requirements Specification (SRS)**: Document the project requirements, including software, hardware, and data needs.
  - **Define Project Goals and Scope**: Finalize objectives, target gestures, and project milestones.

- **Week 2**
  - **Data Collection Plan**: Design a strategy for collecting and preprocessing gesture video data. Identify the gestures to be recognized (e.g., “cat,” “food,” “help”) and set criteria for data quality and consistency.
  - **Development Environment Setup**: Set up and configure Python, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, and OpenCV for real-time processing.
  
**Deliverables**:  
- **Literature Review Report**
- **Project Specification Document**
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing Plan**

### **Phase 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
**Timeline**: Weeks 3 - 4

**Objectives**: Gather, process, and prepare the dataset for model training, ensuring consistency and quality for effective learning.

- **Week 3**
  - **Data Collection**: Capture video sequences representing each target gesture. Gather multiple samples for each gesture to improve model generalization.
  - **Landmark Extraction**: Use MediaPipe to extract face, pose, and hand landmarks from video frames, converting each gesture sequence into a set of feature vectors.
  
- **Week 4**
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize, flatten, and standardize the extracted landmark data for consistency. Ensure all data samples have the same shape and format.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Apply augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, scaling) to expand the dataset and improve the model’s robustness.

**Deliverables**:  
- **Raw Gesture Dataset** (video files)
- **Processed Data** (extracted landmarks in a structured format)
- **Augmented Dataset**

### **Phase 3: Model Development and Training**
**Timeline**: Weeks 5 - 8

**Objectives**: Develop, train, and validate a deep learning model to recognize gestures accurately. Track model performance and refine hyperparameters for optimal results.

- **Week 5 - 6**
  - **Model Design**: Architect an LSTM-based model that can interpret temporal patterns in gesture sequences. Define the model layers, including LSTM and dense layers.
  - **Model Implementation**: Implement the model in TensorFlow, setting up input pipelines and training loops.

- **Week 7**
  - **Training**: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, monitoring performance with accuracy and loss metrics. Track results with TensorBoard for insights into training dynamics.

- **Week 8**
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, LSTM units) to optimize the model’s accuracy.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Test the model on a held-out validation set to assess its generalization performance. Use confusion matrices to identify areas of improvement.

**Deliverables**:  
- **Trained LSTM Model**
- **Training Logs and Performance Metrics**
- **Evaluation Report** (with confusion matrix analysis)

### **Phase 4: Real-Time Inference and Visualization**
**Timeline**: Weeks 9 - 10

**Objectives**: Integrate the trained model into a real-time system using OpenCV and MediaPipe, enabling users to view gesture predictions in real-time through a video interface.

- **Week 9**
  - **Real-Time Prediction Integration**: Incorporate the model with OpenCV’s video capture, enabling the system to make live predictions as gestures are performed.
  - **Visualization Setup**: Design the UI to display predictions and gesture confidence scores in real-time, overlaying relevant information on the video stream.

- **Week 10**
  - **User Testing and Optimization**: Test the system with multiple users to evaluate performance in various lighting and background conditions. Make final adjustments for accuracy and speed.
  - **Documentation**: Prepare user documentation and detailed technical notes on system setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

**Deliverables**:  
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition System**
- **Visualization Interface**
- **User and Technical Documentation**

## Future Directions

Upon project completion, further work could include:

1. **Expanding Gesture Vocabulary**: Extend the model to recognize a larger set of gestures in Persian or other languages.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the model for faster inference, potentially allowing deployment on mobile devices.
3. **Cross-Language Compatibility**: Adapt the system to recognize gestures across different sign languages, making it accessible for more users.
4. **Integration with Speech-to-Text Systems**: Combine gesture recognition with speech-to-text systems to support two-way communication.
